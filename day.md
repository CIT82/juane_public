# Morning
**wake up**
 - as soon as I wake up I go to the restroom and brush my teeth. Wash my face. And basically just wake my body up.
 - then i get dressed and get ready for work. I usually wake up around 6 then leave the house by 7. 
 - I work for a flooring company so that means I go to peoples houses. 

# Afternoon
*at work*
 - while im at work I usually just listen to music or talk to the customer.
 - Im sometimes on a time limit so i stay focused and make sure the job is done great.
 - Me and my co-worker go out and eat lunch. whatever we are feeling that day we will get.
 
 # Night
 ##   After work
  - After work i usually take a shower first so that i could feel better just doing things on my computer.
  ### **School**
   - This time is mainly for school and cathching up on everything that i need to do.
   -If i have time, i could play games for the rest of the night. Which i have a blast doing.
   - and at the end of the day when i get tired i go to sleep and do it all again.
